## Study Tips

1. Mastery of the material takes time. IAAP does not recommend taking this exam if you have less than 1 year of experience. Ensure you have a solid grasp of the fundamentals before registering for an exam date.
2. Flash cards facilitates my style of learning. Creating flash cards takes discipline, but the ease of throwing a set into a bag or taking them with me on my morning walk ensured is ummatched (compared to carrying around the body of knowledge). 
3. Body of Knowledge. Read through the BoK and also take time to read the Related Readings in each of the sections.
4. Quizlets are virtual notecards created and shared by other users. These are a helpful supplement to combine a different perspective into your own. 
5. Reputable Practice Exams - [Princeton course](https://iaap.edunext.io/courses/course-v1:IAAP+CPACC+2021/about)
