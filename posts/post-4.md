## Study Tips

1. Mastery of the material takes time. IAAP does not recommend taking this exam if you have less than 1 year of experience. Ensure you have a solid grasp of the fundamentals before registering for an exam date.
2. Flash cards facilitates my style of learning. Creating flash cards takes discipline, but the ease of throwing a set into a bag or taking them with me on my morning walk ensured is ummatched (compared to carrying around the body of knowledge). 
3. Body of Knowledge. Read through the BoK and also take time to read the Related Readings in each of the sections.
4. Quizlets are virtual notecards created and shared by other users. These are a helpful supplement to combine a different perspective into your own. 
5. Reputable Practice Exams - [Princeton course](https://iaap.edunext.io/courses/course-v1:IAAP+CPACC+2021/about)

## Study Materials to Avoid

1. Practice exams from dubious sources - there were a number of websites with free practice exams, found after searching for "CPACC practice exams". Utilize these at your own risk! Questions/answers seemed wishy/washy and even had folks in the commens arguing with the posted answers! 

## Preparing Your Exam Space

1. Remove post-it notes, whiteboards, and errant scraps of paper near your desk
2. Biometric verification?!?
3. A single monitor 
4. A single mouse and keyboard
5. Two blank sheets of paper and a writing implement.

## Preparing Your Computer

1. Download the secure browser
2. Webcam has to be positioned to provide a profile view of your eyes and keyboard

## Examination tips

1. Use the two sheets of paper allowed. Jot down anything that could be useful when taking the exams like mnemonics, charts, or memory devices.
2. Two of the answers are distractors, one of the answers may seem correct and the other is the most correct. If you're unsure of the answer, eliminate the disctractors and guess!
3. The testing platform is far from frictionless, so keep your cool and roll with whatever comes your way (connection issues, proctor interruptions, etc.)

## Examination Results

1. Expect results in 4-6 weeks
2. Questions aren't all weighted equally; you'll need to wait for your results
