## Study Tips

1. Mastery of the material takes time. IAAP does not recommend taking this exam if you have less than 1 year of experience. Ensure you have a solid grasp of the fundamentals before registering for an exam date.
2. Flash cards facilitates my style of learning. Creating flash cards takes discipline, but the ease of throwing a set into a bag or taking them with me on my morning walk ensured is ummatched (compared to carrying around the body of knowledge).
